      <strong>About Me:</strong>

      <div> <p class="first">
        My name is Diego Aguilar, I graduated Highschool on 2011. I was enrolled and taking classes at HighLine College in Des Moines, Washington for a year, from 2013 to 2014. 30 credits shy of a AA degree. I worked for a PawnShop as I.T. for about a year and a half. My job after that was within the same field I was an At&t Authorized Tech. Which consisted of physical and warranty repair on cellphones, tablets, computers, etc. just about everythig At&t would sell. I enjoyed the aspect of troubleshooting and problem solveing.
        I decided to take a programming class because, after much thought into a future career after severeral "dead end" jobs. Programming was a topic that always caught my attention. I did my own learning on free online training courses, but something that ive always wanted to take the next big step forward.
